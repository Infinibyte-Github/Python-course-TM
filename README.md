# Python-course-TM
Python course excercises from my Python course at Thomas More

## Structure
I made folders for each chapter and excercise. Every exercise folder contains a `main.py` file with the code and an `info.md` file with the problem/question and a preview of the output.

## Disclaimer
You learn way more from making these excercises yourself rather than copying them from this Github. I made this repository as a reference if you are stuck or want to see the solution of another student, not to commit plagiarism! Anyways, have fun coding in Python!
