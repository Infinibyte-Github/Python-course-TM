# Exercise 12 - Chapter 1
A voltage U is applied to 2 series resistors R1 and R2. The current I can be found (using Ohm’s law) as: 𝐼 = 𝑈/(𝑅1+𝑅2). The voltage U2 over resistor R2 is I*R2. Write a program that reads the values of U, R1 and R2 and calculates and prints I and U2 on a single line.

## Output:
```
Enter U[V]: 10
Enter R1[Ohm]: 5000
Enter R2[Ohm]: 5000
I = 0.001000 A, U2 = 5.000000 V
```
